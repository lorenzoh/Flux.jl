# Utility Functions

Flux contains some utility functions for working with data; these functions
help create inputs for your models or batch your dataset.
Other functions can be used to initialize your layers or to regularly execute
callback functions.

## Working with Data

```@docs
Flux.unsqueeze
Flux.stack
Flux.unstack
Flux.chunk
Flux.frequencies
Flux.batch
Flux.batchseq
Base.rpad(v::AbstractVector, n::Integer, p)
```

## Layer Initialization

These are primarily useful if you are planning to write your own layers.
Flux initializes convolutional layers and recurrent cells with `glorot_uniform`
by default.
To change the default on an applicable layer, pass the desired function with the
`init` keyword. For example:
```jldoctest; setup = :(using Flux)
julia> conv = Conv((3, 3), 1 => 8, relu; init=Flux.glorot_normal)
Conv((3, 3), 1=>8, relu)
```

```@docs
Flux.glorot_uniform
Flux.glorot_normal
```

## Model Building

Flux provides some utility functions to help you generate models in an automated fashion.

`outdims` enables you to calculate the spatial output dimensions of layers like `Conv` when applied to input images of a given size.
Currently limited to the following layers:
- basic layers (e.g. `Chain`, `Dense`, `SkipConnection`, etc.)
- convolution-style layers (e.g. `Conv`, `MaxPool`, `CrossCor`, etc.)
- normalisation layers (e.g. `BatchNorm`, `Dropout`, etc.)
- arbitrary functions (done by evaluating the function which can be slow)

Using this utility function lets you automate model building for various inputs like so:
```julia
function make_model(width, height, nchannels, nclasses)
  # returns 1D array of conv layers
  conv_layers = make_conv(width, height, nchannels)
  conv_outsize = outdims(conv_layers, (width, height, nchannels))

  return Chain(conv_layers..., Dense(prod(conv_outsize), nclasses))
end
```

```@docs
Flux.outdims
```

## Model Abstraction

```@docs
Flux.destructure
```

## Callback Helpers

```@docs
Flux.throttle
Flux.stop
```
